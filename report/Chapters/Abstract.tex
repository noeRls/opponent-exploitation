Imperfect game solving is an important field of research in AI. Research has been done on finding or approximating the equilibrium of a game. Once an equilibrium is found, the algorithm does not lose on the long term in a zero-sum game. Opponent exploitation is another approach to game solving, it tries to model the opponent's behavior and exploit it resulting in a higher reward. We will present a way of exploiting the opponent using neural network. We will also explore how far it scales for large information games. We will evaluate our algorithm on multiple poker variants.
